        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. The Sun's radius
        is about 695,000 km, or 109 times that of Earth. <br />Every second, the
        Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in
        the process converts 4 million tons of matter into energy. <br />This
        energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the
        core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat.<br /><a

        Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to
        the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest
        of all the Sun's planets.<br />Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within
        Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the
        Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.<br /><a

        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it the closest to
        Earth. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is
        almost as large and has a similar composition.<br />
        Venus, like Mercury, appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun,
        either as morning star or evening star with a synodic period of 1.6
        years.<br /><a

        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
        known to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be found
        throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
        About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's
        polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is
        land, consisting of continents and islands..<br /><a

        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in
        the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In the English
        language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. <br />Mars is a
        terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere (less than 1% that of
        Earth's), and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to
        Earth's crust, <br />as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has
        surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice
        caps.<a
