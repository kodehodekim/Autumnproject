      <h2>Dwarf Planets</h2>
      <p>
        A dwarf planet is a small planetary-mass object that is in direct orbit
        of the Sun, smaller than any of the eight classical planets but still a
        world in its own right. The prototypical dwarf planet is
        <a class="egg">Pluto</a>.<br />
        The interest of dwarf planets to planetary geologists is that since they
        are possibly differentiated and geologically active bodies, they may
        display planetary geology, <br />an expectation that was borne out by
        the Dawn mission to Ceres and the New Horizons mission to Pluto, both in
        2015. <br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet"

      <h2>Pluto</h2>
      <p>
        Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the
        orbit of Neptune.<br />
        It s the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly
        orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume,
        by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris.<br />
        Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock
        and is much smaller than the inner planets. Compared to Earth's moon,
        Pluto has only one sixth its mass and one third its volume.<br /><a

      <h2>Eris</h2>
      <p>
        Eris is the most massive and second-largest known dwarf planet in the
        Solar System. It is a trans-Neptunian object in the scattered disk and
        has a high-eccentricity orbit.<br />
        Eris was discovered in January 2005 by a Palomar Observatory–based team
        led by Mike Brown and verified later that year. In September 2006, it
        was named after the Greco–Roman goddess of strife and discord.<br />
        Eris is the ninth-most massive known object orbiting the Sun and the
        sixteenth-most massive overall in the Solar System (counting moons). It
        is also the largest object that has not been visited by a spacecraft.<br />
        Eris has been measured at 2,326 ± 12 kilometers in diameter its mass is
        0.28% that of the Earth and 27% greater than that of Pluto, although
        Pluto is slightly larger by volume.<br /><a

      <h2>Haumae</h2>
      <p>
        Haumea is a dwarf planet located beyond Neptune's orbit. <br />It was
        discovered in 2004 by a team headed by Mike Brown of Caltech at the
        Palomar Observatory in the United States and disputably also in 2005 by
        a team headed by José Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Sierra Nevada Observatory
        in Spain, though the latter claim has been contested.<br />
        On September 17, 2008, it was named after Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess
        of childbirth, under the expectation by the International Astronomical
        Union that it would prove to be a dwarf planet.<br />
        Nominal estimates make it the third-largest known trans-Neptunian
        object, after Eris and Pluto, though the uncertainty in best-fit
        modeling slightly overlaps with the larger size estimates for
        Makemake.<br />
        Haumea's mass is about one-third that of Pluto, and 1/1400 that of
        Earth.<br /><a
