      <h2>Planets</h2>
      <p>
        According to the IAU definition, there are eight planets in the Solar
        System, which are:<br />
        Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
        <br />Jupiter is the largest, whereas Mercury is the smallest. The
        planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on
        their composition.<br />
        Terrestrials are similar to Earth, with bodies largely composed of rock
        and metal: <br />Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Earth is the largest
        terrestrial planet.<br />
        Giant planets are significantly more massive than the terrestrials:
        Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.<br />
        They differ from the terrestrial planets in composition. The gas giants,
        Jupiter and Saturn,<br />
        are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and are the most massive
        planets in the Solar System.<br />
        Saturn is one third as massive as Jupiter.<br />
        The ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, are primarily composed of
        low-boiling-point materials <br />such as water, methane, and ammonia,
        with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium.<br /><a

      <h2>The sun</h2>
      <p>
        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. The Sun's radius
        is about 695,000 km, or 109 times that of Earth. <br />Every second, the
        Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, and in
        the process converts 4 million tons of matter into energy. <br />This
        energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the
        core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat.<br /><a

      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to
        the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest
        of all the Sun's planets.<br />Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within
        Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the
        Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°.<br /><a

      <h2>Venus</h2>
      <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it the closest to
        Earth. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is
        almost as large and has a similar composition.<br />
        Venus, like Mercury, appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun,
        either as morning star or evening star with a synodic period of 1.6
        years.<br /><a

      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
        known to harbor life. While large volumes of water can be found
        throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
        About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's
        polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is
        land, consisting of continents and islands..<br /><a

      <p>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in
        the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In the English
        language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war. <br />Mars is a
        terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere (less than 1% that of
        Earth's), and has a crust primarily composed of elements similar to
        Earth's crust, <br />as well as a core made of iron and nickel. Mars has
        surface features such as impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice
        caps.<br /><a

      <h2>Jupiter</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
        System. <br />It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half
        times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but
        slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.<br />Jupiter is
        the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the
        Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times.<br />Jupiter
        is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of
        its mass and one-tenth of its volume. <br /><a

      <h2>Saturn</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the
        Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of
        about nine and a half times that of Earth. <br />It has only one-eighth
        the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is
        over 95 times more massive.<br />
        Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and
        rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep
        layer of metallic hydrogen, <br />an intermediate layer of liquid
        hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer.<br /><a

      <h2>Uranus</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to
        the Greek god of the sky, Uranus.<br />
        It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary
        mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to
        Neptune,<br />
        and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the
        larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. <br />For this reason, scientists
        often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them
        from the other giant planets.<br /><a

      <h2>Neptune</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known solar
        planet. <br />In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by
        diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
        <br />It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than
        its near-twin Uranus. <br />Neptune is denser and physically smaller
        than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational
        compression of its atmosphere. <br />It is referred to as one of the
        solar system's two ice giant planets (the other one being Uranus).<br />
